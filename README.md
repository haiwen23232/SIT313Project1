Introduction: I'd like to introduce my plan and what am i learn. 
In fact, I create three different activities, Main-Activity, Munu-Activity and Order-Activity. 
In this app, those 3 activities represent different functions. In the main-activity, the user need to log in app. 
In the Munu-Activities, the user can select the food and quantity, and see the image of food and price. 
In the last activity, the user can see the result of his previous operation.
